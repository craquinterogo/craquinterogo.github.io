					<h3>(Quant) Portfolio Management</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The good investment decision process/result is the main interest of my professional path so far. On this regard there are plenty of topics I like to research including economic behaviour/performance, macroeconomic analysis, asset allocation, portfolio performance, P&L analysis, trading cost analysis (TCA), P&L attribution (PLA), among others.</p>

					<h3>Risk Management</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Because you cannot deal with uncertainty without consider the relevance of good risk management, there is other field that I like. This field results important in the way it is a mechanism of control of losses, in some sense it may help you to keep under control the emotions of quantitative portfolio management and algo/quant trading. Main interest on market, conterparty, and liquidity risk.</p>

					<h3>Quant/Algorithmic Trading</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I have been a lot intrigated about taking investment decisions under uncertainty, and especially how to deal with it having quantitative tools. I do have experience working with algorithmic trading strategies through broker's APIs using programming laguages as python, C++, C# and Java. Along with it the passion of machine learning applied on algo/quant-trading.</p>

					<h3>Quant Development</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In the current world of finance and capital markets there is no chance to compete without having deep knowledge of how to build tools that support your decision taking process, and that's why a good complement of quantitative development is relevant. My experience has been framed on programming languages such as python, C++, Java and recently Ocaml, Julia and Rust. Some other tools which support this taste is AWS with services like S3, EC2, lambda, athena and Sagemaker.</p>
