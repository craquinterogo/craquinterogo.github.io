This website is to share a bit of my work in quantitative finance and quantitative development so far, and why not, as my formal online curriculum vitae. As you can infer reading links above there are two knowledge fields which are my passion. In this way I want to share my work to let other people see how I build software and some quantitative finance models applied to what I've learned so far, however I should confesse I'm looking how to keep it updated as much as possible, but some times it is a challenge as today.
