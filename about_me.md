My name is Cristian Quintero, and I am a systems engineer and economist, and I will have my master degree in quantitative finance, soon. Yes, I do have to degrees in two knowledge fields that in the first glance could have not some relation, right?. But today all knowledge can be related with software, and in this sense, I did decide to learn about both.

The first question can be raised when someone talk about how to join this two fields is, what things can be join on?. Well, I guess in this moment you could be thinking out on building sotware to support the transactional processes in a bank, for instance .... well, with this two degrees you can do much more than it. A subfield in economics is finance, and one more specific is quantitative finance. In this subfield models are the most useful tool. Quantitative models in some cases are not easy to build, particularly when the amount of information is huge ... and here is when you can apply the software knowledge, for instance. Another example can be build tools to support market transactions, like do risk management to front end people (some people like traders). I must say you can do it as a software developer, of course, but when you want to go more than just build software and add value to the business, really you must to know what are them are talking about.

That is a part of what I think, and why I did what I did. I do hope it has sense for you, but if it doesn´t, don´t worry, we could keep in touch too. I do like to learn continuously, because that is a way to keep my mind working, avoiding the boredom.

I do hope this webpage can be useful to you, to get an insight about my professional approach.
